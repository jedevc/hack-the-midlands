# Kitten Kollector

Kitten Kollector is that tool you've always wanted to run a scavenger hunt,
whether it be in one building or all over a city. Think Pokemon Go. But with
kittens. And made in 24 hours.

Simply generate any number of kittens that you like with a unique code, and
then write down the codes where people can find them. Anyone can then use the
website to redeem the codes and get their kitten.
